A simple, conceptual script to conceptualize a Magic System that would operate similarly to programming.

While the program has the capacity to take a number of inputs within the range of a Hexidecimal Numerical system, there are only 2 inputs that create a result.
This system could facilitate more inputs if designed but, as it is, the system does not work beyond the inputs "1" and "2"
